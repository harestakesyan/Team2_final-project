# I. Background

Cardiovascular disease is "the leading cause of death globally," killing an estimated 17.9 million people each year (World Health Organization). Cardiovascular disease (also known as heart disease) refers to any of a group of conditions affecting one's heart and blood vessels; these conditions can include heart failure, arrhythmia, aortic disease and more (Cleveland Clinic).

The World Health Organization asserts that "unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol" are the most important behavioral risk factors 
as the top behavioral factors contr
risk factors for heart disease include xyz. Our research tem wanted to investigate the validity of their findings andprovide recommendations to reduce risk.
explore thier findings and provide reccomendations.Given its prevalence and the detrimental effect it has on patients and their loved ones, it is imperative to determine the risk factors of heart disease and provide recommendations for reducing risk. This research paper is an attempt to do just that.

## SMART Questions
Specifically, the research team sought to answer the following Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, an Time-oriented (SMART) questions.  

  1. What are the top three factors associated with cardiovascular disease? Does this corroborate the risk factors observed by the World Health Organization?  
  2. What recommendations can be made to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent heart attacks and strokes?  
  3. How accurately an the model predict the probability that a patient has cardiovascular disease?    
  4. Is there any association between an individual's sex and whether they has the 
cardiovascular disease ? Are men more prone to cardiovascular diseases as compared to
women?
